4. Use one hero image or product demo video (no galleries).
5. Mirror ad copy in the subheadline for message match.
6. Highlight 3 key benefits with scannable bullets.
7. Include one primary CTA style; remove secondary CTAs from hero.
8. Add urgency or scarcity (deadline, limited seats, capped bonus).
9. Reduce form fields to the minimum needed (name + email).
10. Place a trust signal near every CTA.
11. Validate mobile layout: headline, CTA, and proof visible above the fold.
12. Optimize page weight under 2 MB (compress images).
13. Track events: CTA click, form submit, scroll depth.
14. Add UTM parameters for every paid channel.
15. Review for clarity: can a new visitor explain the offer in 5 seconds?
