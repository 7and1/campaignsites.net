CampaignSites UTM Naming Guide

Core rules
- Use lowercase, hyphen-separated values.
- Keep it consistent across every channel.
- Never change utm_source within a campaign.

Recommended structure
utm_source: platform (facebook, google, newsletter)
utm_medium: channel type (cpc, paid-social, email)
utm_campaign: offer + month (spring-launch-jan)
utm_term: keyword or audience segment
utm_content: creative or placement (video-a, banner-b)

Examples
https://example.com/offer?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=paid-social&utm_campaign=webinar-jan&utm_content=video-a
https://example.com/offer?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=trial-feb&utm_term=free-trial

Tip: Keep a shared spreadsheet of live campaign names so every teammate stays aligned.
